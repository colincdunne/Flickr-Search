# flickr-search

This project is a simple Flickr search engine. It uses the flickr JSON API with an API key to access the flikr database. 

There is a dropdown to narrow the search parameters by location, the chosen location will be shown on google map in the corner. 

You can add several tags to search with, once you search all the images will appear in a slider, which you can scroll through, 
the image in the center of the slider is displayed in large format beneath the slider wheel.
